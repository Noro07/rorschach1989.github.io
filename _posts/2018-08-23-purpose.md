# A paradoxical statistician

As a practitioner, I'm deeply influenced by [Leo Breiman's blockbuster on statistical modeling](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726). While (traditional) statistical modeling has its inherent elegance, it's empirical performance has been dominated by learning algorithms, with a margin that increases over time. However, like those comments made by Brad Efron or David Cox, we shall never underrate the importance of describing the world with explanable mechanisms, and the machine learning community seems to overstress the agnostic perspective of matematical modeling

# About this blog

Sometimes (but not often) I got confused by some learning algorithms, and there's some tiny chance that I would then try to understand that algorithm from a statistician's perspective. Personally I believe that there may be some statisticians that share similar confusions with me, and I post here some of my thoughts on these problems with the goal of **making it as statistical as it can be**

I'm pure Chinese myself, the reason to maintain my post in English is to avoid making too many embarassing linguistic mixtures that reads like chaos...
